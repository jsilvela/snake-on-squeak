# Snake-Game in Squeak

Code I wrote on Squeak … in 2001. In the file I still have my old work and
personal email addresses, neither of which have worked in ages. (I've deleted them
and added my current one.)

Tested the code again in 2022/May/21 on the latest release of Squeak.
Works perfectly, without modification. Impressive!

You need [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/) to run this.

I wanted to learn graphics/game programming, but I thought the whole panorama
available in Linux/GTK and the toolkits available on win/mac were just too damn
complicated.
When I saw Squeak, I got excited to learn about Morphic an BitBlit.
I decided to make a port of the venerable Snake game. \
It took me 30 minutes!
